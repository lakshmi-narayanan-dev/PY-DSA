Domain name vs Hosting vs Cpanel vs FTP vs Database

Domain Name is like a name to an IP Address / Website. 

Hosting is a kind of harddisk/SSD storage to store my code online.
Examples
Hostinger
Blue Host
Zola Host
Shared hosting is slower compare to VPS hosting [virtual Private Server]

VPS - Amazon, Zolahost VPS - It is buying a dedicated Virtual Server to my website or web application

Cpanel is the technical Control panel for your web hosting account. 
It uploads files and folders securely to the web hosting location.
Cpanel is a kind of Admin Access to the server - email , dependencies , name , connect domain name update.

Examples
Plesk

FTP is File Transfer Protocol , Transferring of Files from one computer to another [here's to the server]
SFTP - Secure FTP
FTP client > where you use to upload Files to Server [Filezilla + Cyberduck]

To return to our analogy: If your hosting account were a car or an airplane, FTP would be the equivalent of keys to doors—and the FTP client would be the stairs that lead you to the doors.


Database = MongoDB = JSON format = Non-relational DB = Scalable 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Servers + DBMS
Nginx - proxy server or web server , Load balancer , Mail Proxy

DB - Stores Client Data

Application Programming Interface = Act as a intermediate between server & client using internet
Commonly used API is REST API = Representational State Transfer API
Simple Request & response operation
Example > Email > Receive OTP to proceed

API Codes
1XX = Informational
2XX = Success
3XX = Redirection
4XX = Client Side Error[html css js files missing or relocated]
5XX = Server Side Error

Famous API Codes
200 = Success OK
500 = Internal server error
400 = Bad request
403 = Forbidden access [not having access to the file]
401 = Unauthorized = Credentials are incorrect
404 = page itself not found
415 = unsupported media format used
429 = too many request [majority in government sites]

Code-Basic-Intro
	
Programs alone to generate outputs - Java , Py
Scripts are sub-programs depending on other programs to show output


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




JS - npm , yarn , VCS , NodeBundle Webpack , Testing Jest , React Library , Angular Framework  , linux environment & Terminal , Primitives [Boolean , String , Number , Undefined, Symbol], Operators [+ - / * %] , Let var const [var , let & const are used to declare variables in js] , Hoisting , Implicit Explicit Conversion , Data structure [Array , Json, Map] , Prototypes [Async , Promises , Closures] , Native Methods [math , sqrt , foreach, ceil] , Paradigms [Functional , Relative , Object] , NodeJs & ExpressJs [Server side J5 , Derby , Meteor , Isometric Applications]

VCS - git, bit bucket

Caching - CDN, Server side, Client Side

Reactjs - CLI Tools [Vite , CRA] , Components [Class, Functional, Basic (Jsx , states vs props , conditional rendering , composition), Rendering [Component Life Cycle , List and keys , Render props, Refs , Events , Higher order components] , Hooks [useState, useEffect, Custom Hooks - useCallBack/useRef/useMemo/useReducer/useContext] , Routers [react router /reach router] , State Management - Recoil , MobX, Redux , Styling - Emotion / Styled / Tailwind / Mantine , API calls - GraphQL[Apollo,Relay] / REST [react-query , Axios, SWR] , Testing [Cypress,Jest] , Frameworks - Remix / NextJS , Forms [React hook Forms , Final Form, Suspense , Portals , error boundaries] , Mobile Apps [React native]  

Angular

Js For React
Closures = Effective Apply = State & Scope manage
DOM manipulation
Higher Order Functions
Callbacks , Promises, Async , Await - Asynchronous programming
ECMAScript - latest feature & update
this & arrow function
Event Listener - interactive applications
Browser based JS debug tools
Prototype Based , difference between = inheritance model & classical model

let , var & const = used to declare variables in js.
Variables = Containers for storing data.

var + let = create variable that can reassign another variable
const = create constant variables that cannot reassign another variable

Developer use = reassign variable [let] & Fixed variable [const]
Don't use var in js , they do not support block level scope

Scope in JS = Block - Function - Local - Global

Scope of variables:
Variable Full

Js is an interpreter that only translates what we say , not a compiler like java executes the entire code > only if it is good > it runs the code.

JIT?

Events in html -> many times in containers or forms
user single click [onclick = “” ] 
User double click [ondblclick = “”]
Hover an element [onmousedown = “”]
Element loses focus [onblur = “”]
Element gets focus [onfocus = “”]
Mouse over an element [onmouseout = “”]
Mouse out of an element [onmouseout = “”]
There is a change [onchange = “”]
On Submitting a form [onsubmit = “”]
Resetting a form [onreset = “”]


Change BG color by click

Javascript Libraries
ReactJS
localhost , 3000
Reactjs - File Structure
node_modules = dependencies via npm/nextjs
public = html + favicons + Files in html meta tag
scr = components + All css + jsx 
All App.js is load on index.js -> index.html
.gitignore = files and folders ignored by git 
package.json = project configuration
package-lock.json = npm packages configuration
readme.md = Read the files for documentational references

Cloud Computing
AWS
Amazon Web Services = Cloud Computing service provider with scalable billing [you pay for what you use - no fixed rate]
EC2, Elastic Compute Cloud
S3, Simple Storage Service

DataBases
Mongo
Show dbs = show all database
db.folder.find(value).count() = show all the count of value entered matches in DB
9 Http request Methods
GET [get data from server and no effect on data]
POST [User data shared to DB using forms or UI actions - Creates a new resource - data included in the body of the request
PUT [update old data, entire resource is updated once]
PATCH [update resource, only updates the field that was included in the request]
DELETE [delete resource]
HEAD [Check a resource is available to get metadata]
OPTIONS -
TRACE
CONNECT


GraphQL
Open source, data query & manipulation of API’s 
Alternative of REST API
Able to fetch exact data you needed to fetch from server
Faster than REST 
example -> Student 1 school fee for this year alone
Client > Specific data to fetch request > GraphQL > Server > Respond to client
Like POST & DELETE in REST, GraphQL has a mutation to update data.
mutation {
add project (key value)
}
GraphQL server has a scheme to specify all types of fields
String = Alphabetic, Boolean = Yes or no, Float = Decimal Numbers, int = numbers.


Git

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Networking
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Host = Server, hosting
IP = Internet Protocol
Loopback, IP Address of loopback is 127.0.0.1 = localhost address
DNS = Domain Name System, Easy to name instead of ip address of a website
ISP = Internet Service Provider
CDN = Content Delivery Network, Used to deliver fast + presents all over the world to increase performance of site. Always use CDN from reputed libraries.
Fast Network = Wired
TCP = Transmission Control Protocol, Slow - reliable, Email, Web browsing = Flow Control
UDP = User Datagram Protocol, Gaming live streams, fast but not guaranteed transfers = No Flow control
HTTPS = HyperText Transfer Protocol with Secure
URL = Uniform Resource Locator
Http port is 80 & No SSL certificate required
Https port is 443 with SSL certificate required

Mail
IMAP = Internet Messaging  Access Protocol > Access mail in multiple devices with past mail history shown
POP3 = Post Office Protocol = receive mail over internet
TLS = Transport Layer Security
SSL = Secure Socket Layer
FTP = File Transfer Protocol, Filezilla, Cpanel, Hpanel = Port 20, 21



Optimal Router Antenna Positioning -> 180 degree / horizontal line is signal zone & 90 degree / vertical line is Dead zone [no signal]

172.16.254.1 = ip address [internet protocol]
country.state.ISP.device.

Https - HyperText Transfer Protocol with Secure
Server Certificate Check -> SSL certificate [Secure Socket Layer] / Server will share the response with certificate to the browser / browser share the certificate to certificate Authority for validation.
